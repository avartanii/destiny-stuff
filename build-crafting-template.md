# Build Crafting Template

**Explanation:** You should copy/paste this template (everything exactly as it is in the grey box) into Discord and fill it out there.

**Rules:**  
  1. You can omit any part that is unspecified
     - For example you can only include a chest piece in the armor section if that's all the build cares about
     - DO NOT however delete an entire section. Instead between the two sets of tick marks (the ```s) just put "* No requirements *"
  2. Try to be as descriptive as you can in the tags so the message can be found later through Search
